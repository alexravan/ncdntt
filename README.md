## Challenges We Faced
We faced a few challenges in setting up -- the first of which was getting everyone
set up on Rails, Ruby, and Postgres with the proper versions. This took us a few hours 
because we were running on two different environments -- two people are on Mac OS 10 
and one is using the Debian VM provided to the class, so there were two different sets 
of issues faced. The most issues were posed by setting up Postgresql, we had trouble
with user accounts and permissions. 

## Why We Chose Rails
We chose Rails because it is the most robust of the Ruby frameworks -- it is easily
managed by RVM and does most of the heavy lifting for the developer. In addition,
due to its recent popularity, there is a wealth of information on almost any problem
we could run into online. 

## Why We Chose Postgresql
We had two viable options of DB -- Postgresql and MySQL. We honestly chose Postgresql
because it seemed like the more popular option, and thus there would be more support 
for it, both in class and online. We haven't had any issues thus far so we are happy 
with our choice.
